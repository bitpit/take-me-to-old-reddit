Take Me To Old Reddit
=====================

What is it
----------
An extension for the Google Chrome (and I'm guessing also Chromium?) browser(s) that automatically redirects any reddit link to the 'old.reddit.com' version, because the redesign sucks, and sometimes you don't want to have to be signed in to default to the original, better reddit experience.

How to use it
-------------
You can install it manually using [these instructions](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/getstarted#manifest) (specifically the list of instructions underneath the **Create the Manifest** section).
If I win the lottery and feel like giving google more money, maybe I'll publish this as a bonafide extension.

Rationale
---------
The reddit redesign is slow, clunky, bloatware, filled with all sorts of gross engagement tracking; and designed to allow for a greater number of ads to be inserted into the content.
I find it abhorent that reddit won't just set a browser cookie if you opt out, and that its tied to the account. As long as old.reddit.com exists, this will be installed in every chrome instance I use regularly.
